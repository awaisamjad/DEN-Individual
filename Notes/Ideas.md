### Making it easier for electronics people to reuse components

### Making it easier for normal people to reuse components

### Making Circuit Boards (PCB's) more reusable
- have the metal sheet itself be reusable
- easier for component extraction while maintaining safety of user and components
- easier to salvage/reuse precious and maybe hazardous metals

### Focus on individual components to reuse/recycle
- LEDs
- Resistors
- Could be done with redesigning the components
